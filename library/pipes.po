"The :mod:`pipes` module is deprecated (see :pep:`PEP 594 <594#pipes>` for "
"details). Please use the :mod:`subprocess` module instead."

msgid ""
"The :mod:`pipes` module defines a class to abstract the concept of a "
"*pipeline* --- a sequence of converters from one file to  another."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because the module uses :program:`/bin/sh` command lines, a POSIX or "
"compatible shell for :func:`os.system` and :func:`os.popen` is required."

"``set -x`` command to be more verbose."

"Append a new action at the end. The *cmd* variable must be a valid bourne "
"shell command. The *kind* variable consists of two letters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first letter can be either of ``'-'`` (which means the command reads its "
"standard input), ``'f'`` (which means the commands reads a given file on the "
"command line) or ``'.'`` (which means the commands reads no input, and hence "
"must be first.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, the second letter can be either of ``'-'`` (which means  the "
"command writes to standard output), ``'f'`` (which means the  command writes "
"a file on the command line) or ``'.'`` (which means the command does not "
"write anything, and hence must be last.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a new action at the beginning. See :meth:`append` for explanations of "
"the arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a file-like object, open to *file*, but read from or written to by "
"the pipeline.  Note that only one of ``'r'``, ``'w'`` may be given."
msgstr ""

msgid "Copy *infile* to *outfile* through the pipe."
