msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides for access to installed "
"package metadata.  Built in part on Python's import system, this library "
"intends to replace similar functionality in the `entry point API`_ and "
"`metadata API`_ of ``pkg_resources``.  Along with :mod:`importlib.resources` "
"in Python 3.7 and newer (backported as `importlib_resources`_ for older "
"versions of Python), this can eliminate the need to use the older and less "
"efficient ``pkg_resources`` package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By \"installed package\" we generally mean a third-party package installed "
"into Python's ``site-packages`` directory via tools such as `pip <https://"
"pypi.org/project/pip/>`_.  Specifically, it means a package with either a "
"discoverable ``dist-info`` or ``egg-info`` directory, and metadata defined "
"by :pep:`566` or its older specifications. By default, package metadata can "
"live on the file system or in zip archives on :data:`sys.path`.  Through an "
"extension mechanism, the metadata can live almost anywhere."

msgid ""
"Let's say you wanted to get the version string for a package you've "
"installed using ``pip``.  We start by creating a virtual environment and "
"installing something into it:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can get the version string for ``wheel`` by running the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also get the set of entry points keyed by group, such as "
"``console_scripts``, ``distutils.commands`` and others.  Each group contains "
"a sequence of :ref:`EntryPoint <entry-points>` objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can get the :ref:`metadata for a distribution <metadata>`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also get a :ref:`distribution's version number <version>`, list its :"
"ref:`constituent files <files>`, and get a list of the distribution's :ref:"
"`requirements`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functional API"
msgstr ""

msgid "This package provides the following functionality via its public API."
msgstr ""

msgid "Entry points"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry_points()`` function returns a collection of entry points. Entry "
"points are represented by ``EntryPoint`` instances; each ``EntryPoint`` has "
"a ``.name``, ``.group``, and ``.value`` attributes and a ``.load()`` method "
"to resolve the value.  There are also ``.module``, ``.attr``, and ``."
"extras`` attributes for getting the components of the ``.value`` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Query all entry points::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry_points()`` function returns an ``EntryPoints`` object, a "
"sequence of all ``EntryPoint`` objects with ``names`` and ``groups`` "
"attributes for convenience::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``EntryPoints`` has a ``select`` method to select entry points matching "
"specific properties. Select entry points in the ``console_scripts`` group::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Equivalently, since ``entry_points`` passes keyword arguments through to "
"select::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pick out a specific script named \"wheel\" (found in the wheel project)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Equivalently, query for that entry point during selection::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Inspect the resolved entry point::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``group`` and ``name`` are arbitrary values defined by the package "
"author and usually a client will wish to resolve all entry points for a "
"particular group.  Read `the setuptools docs <https://setuptools.readthedocs."
"io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins>`_ "
"for more information on entry points, their definition, and usage."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Compatibility Note*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"selectable\" entry points were introduced in ``importlib_metadata`` "
"3.6 and Python 3.10. Prior to those changes, ``entry_points`` accepted no "
"parameters and always returned a dictionary of entry points, keyed by group. "
"For compatibility, if no parameters are passed to entry_points, a "
"``SelectableGroups`` object is returned, implementing that dict interface. "
"In the future, calling ``entry_points`` with no parameters will return an "
"``EntryPoints`` object. Users should rely on the selection interface to "
"retrieve entry points by group."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every distribution includes some metadata, which you can extract using the "
"``metadata()`` function::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The keys of the returned data structure, a ``PackageMetadata``, name the "
"metadata keywords, and the values are returned unparsed from the "
"distribution metadata::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``PackageMetadata`` also presents a ``json`` attribute that returns all the "
"metadata in a JSON-compatible form per :PEP:`566`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Description`` is now included in the metadata when presented through "
"the payload. Line continuation characters have been removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``json`` attribute was added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution versions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``version()`` function is the quickest way to get a distribution's "
"version number, as a string::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also get the full set of files contained within a distribution.  The "
"``files()`` function takes a distribution package name and returns all of "
"the files installed by this distribution.  Each file object returned is a "
"``PackagePath``, a :class:`pathlib.PurePath` derived object with additional "
"``dist``, ``size``, and ``hash`` properties as indicated by the metadata.  "
"For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Once you have the file, you can also read its contents::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the ``locate`` method to get a the absolute path to the "
"file::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the case where the metadata file listing files (RECORD or SOURCES.txt) is "
"missing, ``files()`` will return ``None``. The caller may wish to wrap calls "
"to ``files()`` in `always_iterable <https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/"
"stable/api.html#more_itertools.always_iterable>`_ or otherwise guard against "
"this condition if the target distribution is not known to have the metadata "
"present."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution requirements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get the full set of requirements for a distribution, use the "
"``requires()`` function::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Package distributions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A convenience method to resolve the distribution or distributions (in the "
"case of a namespace package) for top-level Python packages or modules::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Distributions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the above API is the most common and convenient usage, you can get all "
"of that information from the ``Distribution`` class.  A ``Distribution`` is "
"an abstract object that represents the metadata for a Python package.  You "
"can get the ``Distribution`` instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus, an alternative way to get the version number is through the "
"``Distribution`` instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are all kinds of additional metadata available on the ``Distribution`` "
"instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The full set of available metadata is not described here.  See :pep:`566` "
"for additional details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extending the search algorithm"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because package metadata is not available through :data:`sys.path` searches, "
"or package loaders directly, the metadata for a package is found through "
"import system :ref:`finders <finders-and-loaders>`.  To find a distribution "
"package's metadata, ``importlib.metadata`` queries the list of :term:`meta "
"path finders <meta path finder>` on :data:`sys.meta_path`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default ``PathFinder`` for Python includes a hook that calls into "
"``importlib.metadata.MetadataPathFinder`` for finding distributions loaded "
"from typical file-system-based paths."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The abstract class :py:class:`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` defines the "
"interface expected of finders by Python's import system. ``importlib."
"metadata`` extends this protocol by looking for an optional "
"``find_distributions`` callable on the finders from :data:`sys.meta_path` "
"and presents this extended interface as the ``DistributionFinder`` abstract "
"base class, which defines this abstract method::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``DistributionFinder.Context`` object provides ``.path`` and ``.name`` "
"properties indicating the path to search and name to match and may supply "
"other relevant context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What this means in practice is that to support finding distribution package "
"metadata in locations other than the file system, subclass ``Distribution`` "
"and implement the abstract methods. Then from a custom finder, return "
"instances of this derived ``Distribution`` in the ``find_distributions()`` "
"method."
