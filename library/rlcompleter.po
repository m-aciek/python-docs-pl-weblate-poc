"When this module is imported on a Unix platform with the :mod:`readline` "
"module available, an instance of the :class:`Completer` class is "
"automatically created and its :meth:`complete` method is set as the :mod:"
"`readline` completer."

"The :mod:`rlcompleter` module is designed for use with Python's :ref:"

"obvious side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but it can generate "
"calls to :meth:`__getattr__`) up to the last part, and find matches for the "
"rest via the :func:`dir` function.  Any exception raised during the "
"evaluation of the expression is caught, silenced and :const:`None` is "
"returned."
