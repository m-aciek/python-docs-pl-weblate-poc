msgid ":mod:`bdb` --- Debugger framework"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/bdb.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`bdb` module handles basic debugger functions, like setting "
"breakpoints or managing execution via the debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following exception is defined:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Exception raised by the :class:`Bdb` class for quitting the debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`bdb` module also defines two classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and "
"(re-)enabling, and conditionals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Breakpoints are indexed by number through a list called :attr:`bpbynumber` "
"and by ``(file, line)`` pairs through :attr:`bplist`.  The former points to "
"a single instance of class :class:`Breakpoint`.  The latter points to a list "
"of such instances since there may be more than one breakpoint per line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be in canonical "
"form.  If a *funcname* is defined, a breakpoint hit will be counted when the "
"first line of that function is executed.  A conditional breakpoint always "
"counts a hit."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Breakpoint` instances have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file/line.  If it is the "
"last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes the entry for the file/"
"line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mark the breakpoint as enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mark the breakpoint as disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a string with all the information about the breakpoint, nicely "
"formatted:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The breakpoint number."
msgstr ""

msgid "If it is temporary or not."
msgstr ""

msgid "Its file,line position."
msgstr ""

msgid "The condition that causes a break."
msgstr ""

msgid "If it must be ignored the next N times."
msgstr ""

msgid "The breakpoint hit count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print the output of :meth:`bpformat` to the file *out*, or if it is "
"``None``, to standard output."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :class:`Bdb` class acts as a generic Python debugger base class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class takes care of the details of the trace facility; a derived class "
"should implement user interaction.  The standard debugger class (:class:`pdb."
"Pdb`) is an example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *skip* argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style module name "
"patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames that originate in a module "
"that matches one of these patterns. Whether a frame is considered to "
"originate in a certain module is determined by the ``__name__`` in the frame "
"globals."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *skip* argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following methods of :class:`Bdb` normally don't need to be overridden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Auxiliary method for getting a filename in a canonical form, that is, as a "
"case-normalized (on case-insensitive filesystems) absolute path, stripped of "
"surrounding angle brackets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the :attr:`botframe`, :attr:`stopframe`, :attr:`returnframe` and :attr:"
"`quitting` attributes with values ready to start debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is installed as the trace function of debugged frames.  Its "
"return value is the new trace function (in most cases, that is, itself)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default implementation decides how to dispatch a frame, depending on the "
"type of event (passed as a string) that is about to be executed. *event* can "
"be one of the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"line\"``: A new line of code is going to be executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``\"call\"``: A function is about to be called, or another code block "
"entered."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"return\"``: A function or other code block is about to return."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"exception\"``: An exception has occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"c_call\"``: A C function is about to be called."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"c_return\"``: A C function has returned."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"c_exception\"``: A C function has raised an exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the Python events, specialized functions (see below) are called.  For "
"the C events, no action is taken."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *arg* parameter depends on the previous event."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the documentation for :func:`sys.settrace` for more information on the "
"trace function.  For more information on code and frame objects, refer to :"
"ref:`types`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the debugger should stop on the current line, invoke the :meth:"
"`user_line` method (which should be overridden in subclasses). Raise a :exc:"
"`BdbQuit` exception if the :attr:`Bdb.quitting` flag is set (which can be "

"Normally derived classes don't override the following methods, but they may "
"if they want to redefine the definition of stopping and breakpoints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method checks if the *frame* is somewhere below :attr:`botframe` in the "
"call stack.  :attr:`botframe` is the frame in which debugging started."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method checks if there is a breakpoint in the filename and line "
"belonging to *frame* or, at least, in the current function.  If the "
"breakpoint is a temporary one, this method deletes it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method checks if there is a breakpoint in the filename of the current "
"frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Derived classes should override these methods to gain control over debugger "
"operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called from :meth:`dispatch_call` when there is the "
"possibility that a break might be necessary anywhere inside the called "
"function."

"Derived classes and clients can call the following methods to affect the "
"stepping state."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop after one line of code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop on the next line in or below the given frame."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop when returning from the given frame."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Start debugging from *frame*.  If *frame* is not specified, debugging starts "
"from caller's frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Stop only at breakpoints or when finished.  If there are no breakpoints, set "
"the system trace function to ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the :attr:`quitting` attribute to ``True``.  This raises :exc:`BdbQuit` "
"in the next call to one of the :meth:`dispatch_\\*` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Derived classes and clients can call the following methods to manipulate "
"breakpoints.  These methods return a string containing an error message if "
"something went wrong, or ``None`` if all is well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set a new breakpoint.  If the *lineno* line doesn't exist for the *filename* "
"passed as argument, return an error message.  The *filename* should be in "
"canonical form, as described in the :meth:`canonic` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the breakpoints in *filename* and *lineno*.  If none were set, an "
"error message is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the breakpoint which has the index *arg* in the :attr:`Breakpoint."
"bpbynumber`.  If *arg* is not numeric or out of range, return an error "
"message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete all breakpoints in *filename*.  If none were set, an error message is "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete all existing breakpoints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a breakpoint specified by the given number.  If *arg* is a string, it "

msgid "Debug a single function call, and return its result."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, the module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Check whether we should break here, depending on the way the breakpoint *b* "
"was set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If it was set via line number, it checks if ``b.line`` is the same as the "
"one in the frame also passed as argument.  If the breakpoint was set via "
"function name, we have to check we are in the right frame (the right "
"function) and if we are in its first executable line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Determine if there is an effective (active) breakpoint at this line of code. "
"Return a tuple of the breakpoint and a boolean that indicates if it is ok to "
"delete a temporary breakpoint.  Return ``(None, None)`` if there is no "
"matching breakpoint."
