msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The purpose of the :mod:`importlib` package is two-fold. One is to provide "
"the implementation of the :keyword:`import` statement (and thus, by "
"extension, the :func:`__import__` function) in Python source code. This "
"provides an implementation of :keyword:`!import` which is portable to any "
"Python interpreter. This also provides an implementation which is easier to "
"comprehend than one implemented in a programming language other than Python."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Programmatic importing of modules should use :func:`import_module` instead "
"of this function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Import a module. The *name* argument specifies what module to import in "
"absolute or relative terms (e.g. either ``pkg.mod`` or ``..mod``). If the "
"name is specified in relative terms, then the *package* argument must be set "
"to the name of the package which is to act as the anchor for resolving the "
"package name (e.g. ``import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')`` will import "
"``pkg.mod``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`import_module` function acts as a simplifying wrapper around :"
"func:`importlib.__import__`. This means all semantics of the function are "
"derived from :func:`importlib.__import__`. The most important difference "
"between these two functions is that :func:`import_module` returns the "
"specified package or module (e.g. ``pkg.mod``), while :func:`__import__` "
"returns the top-level package or module (e.g. ``pkg``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are dynamically importing a module that was created since the "
"interpreter began execution (e.g., created a Python source file), you may "
"need to call :func:`invalidate_caches` in order for the new module to be "
"noticed by the import system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parent packages are automatically imported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Find the loader for a module, optionally within the specified *path*. If the "
"module is in :attr:`sys.modules`, then ``sys.modules[name].__loader__`` is "
"returned (unless the loader would be ``None`` or is not set, in which case :"
"exc:`ValueError` is raised). Otherwise a search using :attr:`sys.meta_path` "
"is done. ``None`` is returned if no loader is found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A dotted name does not have its parents implicitly imported as that requires "
"loading them and that may not be desired. To properly import a submodule you "
"will need to import all parent packages of the submodule and use the correct "
"argument to *path*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``__loader__`` is not set, raise :exc:`ValueError`, just like when the "
"attribute is set to ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use :func:`importlib.util.find_spec` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Invalidate the internal caches of finders stored at :data:`sys.meta_path`. "
"If a finder implements ``invalidate_caches()`` then it will be called to "
"perform the invalidation.  This function should be called if any modules are "
"created/installed while your program is running to guarantee all finders "
"will notice the new module's existence."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reload a previously imported *module*.  The argument must be a module "
"object, so it must have been successfully imported before.  This is useful "
"if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want "
"to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter.  The "
"return value is the module object (which can be different if re-importing "
"causes a different object to be placed in :data:`sys.modules`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "When :func:`reload` is executed:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python module's code is recompiled and the module-level code re-executed, "
"defining a new set of objects which are bound to names in the module's "
"dictionary by reusing the :term:`loader` which originally loaded the "
"module.  The ``init`` function of extension modules is not called a second "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with all other objects in Python the old objects are only reclaimed after "
"their reference counts drop to zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The names in the module namespace are updated to point to any new or changed "
"objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Other references to the old objects (such as names external to the module) "
"are not rebound to refer to the new objects and must be updated in each "
"namespace where they occur if that is desired."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are a number of other caveats:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module's global "
"variables) is retained.  Redefinitions of names will override the old "
"definitions, so this is generally not a problem.  If the new version of a "
"module does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old "
"definition remains.  This feature can be used to the module's advantage if "
"it maintains a global table or cache of objects --- with a :keyword:`try` "
"statement it can test for the table's presence and skip its initialization "
"if desired::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is generally not very useful to reload built-in or dynamically loaded "
"modules.  Reloading :mod:`sys`, :mod:`__main__`, :mod:`builtins` and other "
"key modules is not recommended.  In many cases extension modules are not "
"designed to be initialized more than once, and may fail in arbitrary ways "
"when reloaded."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a module imports objects from another module using :keyword:`from` ... :"
"keyword:`import` ..., calling :func:`reload` for the other module does not "
"redefine the objects imported from it --- one way around this is to re-"
"execute the :keyword:`!from` statement, another is to use :keyword:`!import` "
"and qualified names (*module.name*) instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that "
"defines the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances "
"--- they continue to use the old class definition.  The same is true for "
"derived classes."

"For deep customizations of import, you typically want to implement an :term:"

"on your needs: a :term:`meta path finder` or a :term:`path entry finder`. "
"The former is what you would put on :attr:`sys.meta_path` while the latter "
"is what you create using a :term:`path entry hook` on :attr:`sys.path_hooks` "
"which works with :attr:`sys.path` entries to potentially create a finder. "
