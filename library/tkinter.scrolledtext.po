"The :mod:`tkinter.scrolledtext` module provides a class of the same name "
"which implements a basic text widget which has a vertical scroll bar "
"configured to do the \"right thing.\"  Using the :class:`ScrolledText` class "
"is a lot easier than setting up a text widget and scroll bar directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The text widget and scrollbar are packed together in a :class:`Frame`, and "
"the methods of the :class:`Grid` and :class:`Pack` geometry managers are "
"acquired from the :class:`Frame` object.  This allows the :class:"
"`ScrolledText` widget to be used directly to achieve most normal geometry "
"management behavior."
