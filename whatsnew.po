"Python 1.6 can be thought of as the Contractual Obligations Python "
"release. After the core development team left CNRI in May 2000, CNRI "
"requested that a 1.6 release be created, containing all the work on "
"Python that had been performed at CNRI.  Python 1.6 therefore represents "
"the state of the CVS tree as of May 2000, with the most significant new "
"feature being Unicode support.  Development continued after May, of "
"course, so the 1.6 tree received a few fixes to ensure that it's forward-"

"you have applications to maintain, there seems little point in breaking "
"things by moving to 1.6, fixing them, and then having another round of "
"breakage within a month by moving to 2.0; you're better off just going "
"straight to 2.0.  Most of the really interesting features described in "

"The most important change in Python 2.0 may not be to the code at all, "
"but to how Python is developed: in May 2000 the Python developers began "
"using the tools made available by SourceForge for storing  source code, "
"tracking bug reports, and managing the queue of patch submissions.  To "
"report bugs or submit patches for Python 2.0, use the bug tracking and "

"The most important of the services now hosted at SourceForge is the "
"Python CVS tree, the version-controlled repository containing the source "
"code for Python. Previously, there were roughly 7 or so people who had "
"write access to the CVS tree, and all patches had to be inspected and "
"checked in by one of the people on this short list. Obviously, this "
"wasn't very scalable.  By moving the CVS tree to SourceForge, it became "
"possible to grant write access to more people; as of September 2000 there"
" were 27 people able to check in changes, a fourfold increase.  This "
"makes possible large-scale changes that wouldn't be attempted if they'd "
"have to be filtered through the small group of core developers.  For "
"example, one day Peter Schneider-Kamp took it into his head to drop K&R C"
" compatibility and convert the C source for Python to ANSI C. After "
"getting approval on the python-dev mailing list, he launched into a "
"flurry of checkins that lasted about a week, other developers joined in "
"to help, and the job was done.  If there were only 5 people with write "
"access, probably that task would have been viewed as \"nice, but not "
"worth the time and effort needed\" and it would never have gotten done."

"The shift to using SourceForge's services has resulted in a remarkable "

"bounced back and forth between people until the patch is deemed worth "
"checking in.  Bugs are tracked in one central location and can be "
"assigned to a specific person for fixing, and we can count the number of "
"open bugs to measure progress.  This didn't come without a cost: "
"developers now have more e-mail to deal with, more mailing lists to "
"follow, and special tools had to be written for the new environment. For "
"example, SourceForge sends default patch and bug notification e-mail "
"messages that are completely unhelpful, so Ka-Ping Yee wrote an HTML "

"The ease of adding code caused a few initial growing pains, such as code "

"somewhat similar to that used by the Apache group. Developers can vote "
"+1, +0, -0, or -1 on a patch; +1 and -1 denote acceptance or rejection, "
"while +0 and -0 mean the developer is mostly indifferent to the change, "
"though with a slight positive or negative slant.  The most significant "
"change from the Apache model is that the voting is essentially advisory, "
"letting Guido van Rossum, who has Benevolent Dictator For Life status, "
