"Note that the :c:type:`PyTypeObject` for ``None`` is not directly exposed in "
"the Python/C API.  Since ``None`` is a singleton, testing for object "
"identity (using ``==`` in C) is sufficient. There is no :c:func:"
"`PyNone_Check` function for the same reason."

"The Python ``None`` object, denoting lack of value.  This object has no "
