msgid ""
"Code objects are a low-level detail of the CPython implementation. Each one "
"represents a chunk of executable code that hasn't yet been bound into a "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The C structure of the objects used to describe code objects.  The fields of "
"this type are subject to change at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is an instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` representing the Python :class:"
"`code` type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *co* is a :class:`code` object.  This function always "
"succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the number of free variables in *co*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new code object.  If you need a dummy code object to create a "
"frame, use :c:func:`PyCode_NewEmpty` instead.  Calling :c:func:`PyCode_New` "
"directly can bind you to a precise Python version since the definition of "
"the bytecode changes often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyCode_New`, but with an extra \"posonlyargcount\" for "
"positional-only arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new empty code object with the specified filename, function name, "
"and first line number.  It is illegal to :func:`exec` or :func:`eval` the "
"resulting code object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the line number of the instruction that occurs on or before "
"``byte_offset`` and ends after it. If you just need the line number of a "
"frame, use :c:func:`PyFrame_GetLineNumber` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For efficiently iterating over the line numbers in a code object, use `the "
"API described in PEP 626 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/#out-of-"
"process-debuggers-and-profilers>`_."
