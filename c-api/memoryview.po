msgid "MemoryView objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`memoryview` object exposes the C level :ref:`buffer interface "
"<bufferobjects>` as a Python object which can then be passed around like any "
"other object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object from an object that provides the buffer "
"interface. If *obj* supports writable buffer exports, the memoryview object "
"will be read/write, otherwise it may be either read-only or read/write at "
"the discretion of the exporter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object using *mem* as the underlying buffer. *flags* can "
"be one of :c:macro:`PyBUF_READ` or :c:macro:`PyBUF_WRITE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object wrapping the given buffer structure *view*. For "
"simple byte buffers, :c:func:`PyMemoryView_FromMemory` is the preferred "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object to a :term:`contiguous` chunk of memory (in "
"either 'C' or 'F'ortran *order*) from an object that defines the buffer "
"interface. If memory is contiguous, the memoryview object points to the "
"original memory. Otherwise, a copy is made and the memoryview points to a "
"new bytes object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if the object *obj* is a memoryview object.  It is not currently "
"allowed to create subclasses of :class:`memoryview`.  This function always "
"succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a pointer to the memoryview's private copy of the exporter's buffer. "
"*mview* **must** be a memoryview instance; this macro doesn't check its "
"type, you must do it yourself or you will risk crashes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return either a pointer to the exporting object that the memoryview is based "
"on or ``NULL`` if the memoryview has been created by one of the functions :c:"
"func:`PyMemoryView_FromMemory` or :c:func:`PyMemoryView_FromBuffer`. *mview* "
"**must** be a memoryview instance."
